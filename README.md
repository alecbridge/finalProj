#League Champion Cheatsheet

##Goal
Besides lost knowledge from high school days, I had no experience coding. That was until earlier this year I attended The Iron Yard, a 12 week immersive coding "bootcamp" of teaching from the ground up. In this course it all ended with a final project of our choosing, something to encapsulate what we have learned. The only criteria being it needed some sort of interactivity to it and have a justifiable use. After learning about API's and their uses I looked into the Riot Games API. As a lover of the PC game League of Legends I sought out for ideas as to what could I make with this new knowledge, and this is just the first one. A creative redesign/reimagination of their character pages.

##Design
Choosing to redesign their existing pages is a bit daunting but was still fun. The overall feeling I was going for was easily to digest "champion cards" with the immediate information you would want to know about a given character, all while being responsive and useable on different devices.


###Landing Page
 Tried to keep the landing page simple. Added a quick note at the bottom to lead to an about page, explaining the same stuff but for if someone found the site through the internet or a link. The main part of this is an enticing picture with characters that someone not familiar with the game may ask "I wonder who these characters are?" which would be answered upon entering. After entering all images and information is provided directly from the Riot Games API.


###Champion List
Here is where the "champion card" motif starts. The list of 132 characters provided in streamlined sections each with a sidebar. The sidebar with the starring feature is where the functionality comes into play. The use of it is up to you, whether you star characters that are your favorites to play, or ones that you are wanting to learn about. The information of what is starred is stored locally so that if you were to close out and come back later the same ones will still be kept starred. Clicking a picture/name on one of the cards with bring you to that individual's page.

###Champion Page
Right away again with the whole "champion card" feel, at the top like most other playing cards; you get the now expanded image and their name and title. Like mentioned aboved, going for easily digestable information that could either be resized in a corner of your screen while playing or on a phone. One of the points of this page was to cut out a bunch of the extraneous information from the bits you needed to know in the game itself. The stats section provides what I felt was some of the more important in-game stats to keep an eye on. Below that is a synopsis of what their abilities do, in this case cutting out all the numbers of exact damages, percentages, etc.

##TL;DR
Took a 12 week long course to learn how to code, this if my final project for it. Slightly interactive user friendly site to learn or remind yourself of the many characters in the game League of Legends cutting out extraneous information.
